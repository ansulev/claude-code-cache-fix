| # | Title | State | Our involvement |
|---|-------|-------|-----------------|
| [#34629](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34629) | Prompt cache regression in --resume (~20x cost) | Closed | Root cause analysis, interceptor fix. Original bug that started this work. |

TigerKay1926 has contradicting data (stuck 5m TTL). Vergil824 confirmed npm vs standalone cache difference, shared 1h cache patch — pointed to our interceptor (2026-04-09). |
| [#42260](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/42260) | Resume loads disproportionate tokens from thinking signatures | Open | Posted analysis of opaque thinking token overhead. |
| [#27048](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/27048) | Prompt cache invalidation on resume: plugin state changes | Open | Posted interceptor as solution, replied to thoeltig re: plugin registration logic (2026-04-08). |

| [#44724](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/44724) | Subagent cache miss on first SendMessage resume | Open | Posted analysis — cache_read=0 suggests system prompt differs between Agent and SendMessage, not just block scatter. Asked for mitmproxy diff. (2026-04-08) |

| [#45572](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/45572) | CLI usage classified as API billing on Max | Open | Posted isClaudeAISubscriber() source analysis — none of the false conditions apply to their setup. Suggested subprocess auth context and Apr 4 backend regression. Offered interceptor for instrumentation. (2026-04-09) |
| [#44869](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/44869) | Prompt cache completely broken — 16-26K on "hello" | Open | Posted root cause explanation (readdir jitter, resume scatter, TTL gating) and interceptor fix. (2026-04-09) |
| [#43657](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/43657) | Resume/continue cache invalidation | **Reopened** | Was closed, simpolism claimed "fixed in 2.1.97" — we posted test data showing scatter still present. Reopened after our comment. (2026-04-09) |

| User | Issue | What was fixed |
|------|-------|---------------|
| @bilby91 | [#44045](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/44045) | 1h cache TTL preserved with interceptor on Agent SDK. Tool reorder fix shipped in v1.5.1. Fresh-session sort fix shipped in v1.6.2 — root cause: `normalizeResumeMessages` early-return on `length < 2` left first call unsorted, busting cache prefix on every resume turn. |

## Issues needing our attention

### Completed (2026-04-10 afternoon — v1.6.2 release)
- **v1.6.2 shipped to npm.** Three changes:
  - fix: fresh-session sort/pin (#5, bilby91 #44045) — removed `messages.length < 2` early return. Validated on CC v2.1.97 + v2.1.100, call 2 cache_read = call 1 cache_creation to the exact token.
  - feat: opt-in identity normalization (#6, labzink #44724) — `CACHE_FIX_NORMALIZE_IDENTITY=1` rewrites Agent SDK identity in `system[1]` to canonical Claude Code identity, fixing Agent()→SendMessage() cache parity.
  - feat: opt-in output efficiency rewrite hook (#1/#4, @VictorSun92 PR) — `CACHE_FIX_OUTPUT_EFFICIENCY_REPLACEMENT` rewrites the `# Output efficiency` system prompt section.
- #44724: labzink confirmed system[1] identity diff via mitmproxy. Posted v1.6.2 update with opt-in fix instructions.
- #41930: Replied to 2008sliu re: npm vs binary install + v2.1.100 status.
- v2.1.100 shipped 05:00 UTC. Tested with v1.6.2 — interceptor works, CC scatter still present.

### Completed (2026-04-10 morning)
- #45572: Posted isClaudeAISubscriber() source analysis for odgriff79. First comment on the issue.
- #44869: Posted cache bug root cause explanation and interceptor fix for talesmetal. First comment on the issue.
- #43657: Countered simpolism's "fixed in 2.1.97" claim with v2.1.97 test data showing resume scatter still present. Reopened by simpolism after our comment.
- #45756: Posted to defend against bot auto-closure. Shared v1.6.1 quota tracking capability, validated molu0219's analysis.

### Completed (2026-04-09)
- #41930: Source code analysis of "API Usage Billing" header + auth fallback behavior for Alpha2Zulu1872 (thumbs-up received). Replied to marcuspuchalla (tool search + interceptor) and Adanielyan92 (interceptor recommendation).
- #44045: bilby91 tested interceptor, 1h TTL confirmed. Debug trace received via email — root cause: readdir ordering jitter + whitespace diff. v1.5.1 shipped with sortDeferredToolsBlock + content pinning fix. Posted sanitized findings publicly.
- #42052: Replied to Vergil824 — acknowledged npm vs standalone finding, pointed to our interceptor.
- #43044: Silently closed by Anthropic. Logged in internal tracker.
